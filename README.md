## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook contains convenient, and user-friendly functions for creating publication-quality visualizations of micro-XRF data, allows opportunities for computing element ratios or more advanced data analysis, and has built-in functions for clustering and automated mineralogy using [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [HDBSCAN combined with DBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to_use_epsilon.html). The visualizations are built using the [Hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org)/[Holoviews](https://holoviews.org) library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required libraries:
-pandas 
-numpy 
-panel 
-xarray 
-bokeh 
-hvplot v 0.8.3 
-holoviews v 1.18.3
